## Barometer
A reimagining of a classic barometer using a BMP280 pressure sensor

The displays are both Dowty aircraft magnetic indicators which are similar to split-flap displays classically used in train stations

The display can show high/low/normal pressure and up/down arrows + "auto". The relays are overkill (the power supply is 28v and the displays when active take ~30mA) but I had them to hand.
